# Emo-Journal
A small python application that could capture our photo and detect our facial emotions.
The application then gives a formal voice output based on our detected emotion,and then opens a notepad.
Our idea is to bring back the nostalgic dairy writting memory.

The dataset used is Facial Emotion recognition 2013 - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013">"fer2013.csv"</a>
